<p> 
To explore climate dynamics of tidally locked Earth-like exoplanets
and to illustrate how the climate would adjust if Earth abruptly entered 
a tidally locked state, we conducted simulations with the GFDL CM2.1 
coupled climate model 
(<a href="#tidally_locked_refs">Delworth et al. 2006</a>).
Starting from a typical January 1
initial condition in the present-day climate, we set the planetary 
rotation rate to 1/365th of the 
present value (so that 1 day is equal to 1 current Earth year). We
fixed the insolation so that there is a perpetual subsolar point on the
equator at 88&deg;W (near the coast of Ecuador). The simulation was run
for 50&nbsp;years. This simulation with a comprehensive coupled climate 
model illustrates and expands upon
the dynamics discussed in the context of an aquaplanet atmosphere-only
model in <a href="#tidally_locked_refs">Merlis and Schneider (2010)</a>.</p>

</largefont>

<p>
The surface temperature changes rapidly over land masses to day-side values 
of about 290&nbsp;K and to night-side values of about 240&nbsp;K. The ocean 
surface temperature changes more slowly; the night-side ocean remains near 
the freezing point for the length of the simulation.</p>

</largefont>

<p>
Precipitation patterns change rapidly (within a few months) from the 
zonally-elongated intertropical convergence zone that is typical of 
Earth today to a configuration in which there is substantial 
precipitation near the subsolar point and little precipitation on
the night-side of the planet. The regions of large precipitation are 
determined by the atmospheric circulation: the near-surface atmospheric 
flow converges near the subsolar point, leading to strong ascending motion 
and condensation 
(see <a href="#tidally_locked_refs">Merlis and Schneider (2010)</a>
for a detailed discussion). The topography (e.g., the Andes) modulate the
precipitation patterns so that they are less concentric about the subsolar
point than in the aquaplanet simulations in Merlis and Schneider (2010).</p>

</largefont>

<p> 
The net evaporation field (evaporation minus precipitation) shows that 
atmospheric water vapor is transported from the night side to the day side.
Regions on the day side of the planet away from the subsolar point, such as
Canada, experience net drying. They become relatively warm because of the 
loss of evaporation as a cooling mechanism for the surface. Sufficiently 
far from the subsolar point, there is net evaporation, which eventually 
would lead to the formation of deserts and complicating habitability of 
those regions.</p>

<a HREF="http://www.meteo.mcgill.ca/~tmerlis/images/coupled_tidal_seaice.mov">Sea Ice Animation (4.6 MB)</a>
</largefont>

<p>
Because the ocean is actively convecting where it is near freezing, no sea ice
forms during this simulation, except near the coasts. However, the ocean 
surface will eventually freeze (on the much longer timescales needed to cool the entire water column to freezing).<br>
It may seem surprising that no widespread sea ice forms on the night side 
of the planet within 50 years; after all, new sea ice forms every winter in 
Earth's high latitudes. However, Earth's polar regions currently experience 
net precipitation, and the fresh water effect on the ocean density allows 
the surface to freeze without the need for the entire column of ocean water 
to reach the freezing point. In contrast, the night side of the tidally 
locked Earth experiences net evaporation, so the ocean surface is becoming
cooler <em>and</em> saltier, so convection penetrates deeper into the interior
ocean as the simulation progresses and prevents the surface from freezing.</p>
