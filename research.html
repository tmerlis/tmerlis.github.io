<h3>Atmospheric circulations and hydrological cycle</h3>

<p> The hydrological cycle and large-scale atmospheric circulations
play a fundamental role in determining climate changes. Understanding
how the water vapor, angular momentum, and energy balances of Earth's
atmosphere respond to radiative forcing is central to interpreting
future climate projections and paleoclimate reconstructions. The
figure to the right illustrates how both changes in the humidity
distribution ("thermodynamic" changes) and in the time-mean circulation 
of the atmosphere
("dynamic" changes) can affect the
precipitation response to variations in the time of year when the
Earth is closest to the Sun (orbital precession). This figure is
  adapted from Merlis, Schneider, Bordoni, and Eisenman 2013 (available <a href="publications/merlis_precession_precip.pdf">here</a>).

<p> The response of tropical cyclone (or hurricane)
frequency to climate changes and the factors controlling the
climate dependence of cyclogenesis have important implications
for risk assessment.
My research makes use of
recently developed high-resolution global atmospheric general
circulation models, which are capable of explicitly simulating tropical
cyclones and global-scale circulations.
The figure to the left shows tropical cyclone tracks from an 
aquaplanet simulation. We have demonstrated that the 
use of simplified boundary conditions
can clearly isolate important factors, such as the latitude of 
the maximum tropical rainfall,  in determining tropical
cyclone frequency.

<h3>Climate sensitivity</h3>

<TABLE width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center">
<tr>

 <td align=justify valign=top style="padding-top: 0em; padding-left: 0em;">

<p> The response of the global-mean surface temperature to changes in
greenhouse gas concentrations&mdash;the climate sensitivity&mdash;is a key
aspect of uncertainty in projections of future climate. Observed
changes, such as the climate response to volcanic eruptions, may be
helpful constraints on the climate sensitivity. However, uncertainties
associated with internal climate variability and possible
nonlinearities in the climate system must be assessed. The figure to
the right shows the short-term surface temperature anomaly (normalized
by the global mean anomaly) for three different radiative forcing
simulations: abruptly doubled carbon dioxide concentration (top),
abruptly halved carbon dioxide concentration (middle), and
stratospheric aerosol radiative forcing of the volcanic eruption of
Mount Pinatubo (bottom). This climate model-based result suggests
the similarity between warming and cooling perturbations and
between different radiative forcing agents (carbon dioxide
vs. stratospheric aerosols) is adequate for the observed climate
response following volcanic eruptions to be a constraint on
the transient climate response to increases in greenhouse gas concentration.
