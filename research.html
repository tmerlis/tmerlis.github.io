<h3>Atmospheric circulations and hydrological cycle</h3>

<p> The hydrological cycle and large-scale atmospheric circulations
play a fundamental role in determining climate changes. Understanding
how the water vapor, angular momentum, and energy balances of Earth's
atmosphere respond to radiative forcing is central to interpreting
future climate projections and paleoclimate reconstructions. The
  figure to the right illustrates how individual percentiles of
  precipitation change in response to greenhouse warming
  at different latitudes, with red indicating
  decreases and blue indicating increases.
  Both "thermodynamic" changes, from atmospheric water vapor,
  and "dynamic" changes, from the winds, affect the total precipitation
  changes that are shown in the top panel.
  Using a novel simulation
  strategy, we show that the isolated effect of 
  thermodynamic changes largely accounts for the
  total precipitation changes across the distribution (bottom panel).

<h3>Tropical cyclones and climate change</h3>

<p> 
  Tropical cyclones (or hurricanes) are one of the most destructive forms of extreme weather. The science of their responses to climate change has important implications for risk assessment. My research uses high-resolution global atmospheric models, capable of explicitly simulating tropical cyclones, to develop an understanding of the larger-scale climatic controls on them. We have used idealized boundary condition simulations, such as aquaplanets, to clearly isolate factors such as the latitude of maximum tropical precipitation in determining tropical cyclone number and the thermodynamic controls on changes in tropical cyclone rainfall. This figure is adapted from a review article by Merlis & Held 2019 (available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40641-019-00133-y">here</a>).

<h3>Climate sensitivity and regional changes</h3>

<TABLE width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center">
<tr>

 <td align=justify valign=top style="padding-top: 0em; padding-left: 0em;">

<p> The response of the global-mean surface temperature to changes in
greenhouse gas concentrations&mdash;the climate sensitivity&mdash;is a key
  aspect of uncertainty in projections of future climate.
  Beyond the global mean, the pattern of temperature change has important
  regional features, such as enhanced warming in the Arctic.
  The figure to shows that the polar atmosphere has different
  atmospheric temperature responses for different climate perturbations:
  there is more surface temperature change, particularly near the surface,
  for warming from increased carbon dioxide concentration (red) compared
  to changes in solar radiation (yellow) or atmospheric energy
  transport changes (green). This dependence on how the high-latitude
  climate is forced gives rise to residual polar warming in
  typical solar radiation management geoengineering scenarios.
